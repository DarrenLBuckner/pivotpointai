<!-- This is a placeholder for the favicon image -->
<!-- You'll need to save your image as one of these formats and names: -->

<!-- Option 1: Save as favicon.ico in src/app/ directory (replaces existing) -->
<!-- Option 2: Save as favicon.png in public/ directory -->

<!-- For best results, your image should be: -->
<!-- - 32x32 pixels (minimum) -->
<!-- - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 64x64 sizes for .ico -->
<!-- - Square format -->
<!-- - Simple design that works at small sizes -->
